# Feature Implementation Plan: Remove Elevation Component from Calculations

## Goal
The goal of this feature is to remove the elevation component from our calculations as it has been identified as providing minimal value to users and is unnecessarily complicating the project. This will streamline our calculations and improve overall performance.

## File Changes

### 1. `src/pop_fly/core.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Identify and remove all functions and methods that reference the elevation component.
  - Update any calculations that currently include elevation to ensure they function correctly without it.
  - Ensure that any constants or variables related to elevation are also removed.

### 2. `src/pop_fly/web/app.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Modify any API endpoints that return data including elevation to ensure they no longer include this component.
  - Update any logic that processes elevation data to prevent errors or unnecessary processing.

### 3. `tests/test_core.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Remove or update existing unit tests that validate the functionality of the elevation component.
  - Add new unit tests to ensure that calculations are correct without the elevation component.

### 4. `tests/test_api.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Update tests that validate API responses to ensure that elevation is no longer included in the responses.
  - Add tests to verify that the application behaves correctly when elevation is not part of the calculations.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Run all existing unit tests to ensure that removing the elevation component does not break any functionality.
  - Specifically focus on tests in `test_core.py` and `test_api.py` to verify that calculations and API responses are correct without elevation.
  
- **End-to-End Tests**: 
  - Conduct manual testing of the application to ensure that all features work as expected without elevation.
  - Verify that user interfaces and reports that previously displayed elevation data are updated accordingly.

## Risks
- **Data Integrity**: There is a risk that removing elevation could inadvertently affect other calculations or features that may have relied on elevation indirectly. Careful review of all related code is necessary.
- **User Impact**: Users may have become accustomed to the elevation data being present. Clear communication about the change and its benefits will be essential to mitigate any potential dissatisfaction.
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensure that all edge cases are covered in the tests to avoid regressions. It may be necessary to add additional tests if any unexpected behavior is observed during testing.

By following this plan, we can effectively remove the elevation component from our calculations while ensuring the integrity and performance of the application.
